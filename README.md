# CoffeeHipsterAPI
This repository represents the ASP.NET WebAPI backend to my iOS application, that features an AngularJs content administration panel. The sole purpose for this application / repository is to provide an example of my work. Also coffee is cool... and hipsters make great coffee.


It's still in it's infancy but you can view the live application here:
